Installation instructions for Feff10:

Feff10 is distributed as fortran source code, and must be compiled and linked
to make an executable program.  There are two different forms for the
distributed code here:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------


The src  directory contains the FEFF10 source code
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following commands are available through the Makefile
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Use commands:
   make        - compiles sequential modular code (see script 'feff')
   make mpi    - compiles parallel modular code (see script 'feffmpi')
                 edit POT/Makefile to change number of processors
   make src    - generate sequential modular code  (files below)
                ff2x_tot.f    genfmt_tot.f  path_tot.f    rdinp_tot.f
                fms_tot.f     ldos_tot.f    pot_tot.f     xsph_tot.f
   make srcmpi - generate parallel modular code  (file above)
   make clean  - to switch between parallel and sequential version,
                 also to clean directories from *.o files

The Compiler.mk defines the Fortran compiler and its options.  It is not necessary
to edit the Makefile, unless you are a developer.

Directories with FORTRAN subroutines
----------------------------
ATOM  - single configuration atomic code subroutines
COMMON - set of general use routines to write warnings, headers,
          make string operations, etc..
DEBYE - Debye-Waller factors subroutines: correlated Debye model,
        equation of motion and recursion methods for DW factors;
EXCH  - various models (LDA, (HF+LDA)/2) for ground and EXCITED state
        exchange-correlation potential
FF2X - various spectroscopy calculations (absorption, emission, scattering)
FMS - full multiple scattering routines

        for spherically symmetric potential
GENFMT - Rehr-Albers scattering F-matrix routines
HEADERS - routines for the headers, written into output files
LDOS - DOS calculations
MATH - math routines: bessel fuctions, rotation matrices, 3j, etc..
PAR - parallel processing routines ( or dummy routines)
PATH - pathfinder
POT - routines for SCF calculation of potential
